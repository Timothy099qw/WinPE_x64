## üíø Create a Bootable USB (FAT32, < 32 GB)

**Important:** The USB drive must be FAT32 and **less than 32 GB**. This process will overwrite the drive ‚Äî back up any important data.

1. Format your USB drive as **FAT32** and ensure it is empty.
2. Download and extract the archive from the Mega link above.
3. From the extracted folder, locate the `1v0.1.2` directory.
4. **Copy everything under the `1v0.1.2` folder** directly to the **root** of the USB drive.

Example final layout:
USB_DRIVE:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ boot
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sources
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ EFI
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bootmgr
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ bootmgr.efi

5. Insert the USB into the target machine and boot from it using the system boot menu (BIOS/UEFI).

## üîß High-level Feature Overview

TPE aims to provide a GUI-first environment for lawful system maintenance, diagnostics, and deployment. High-level capabilities include:

- Modern hardware support (touchpads, high-DPI screens, SD Drives, Intel RST/RAID metadata handling, common NVMe controllers, etc.)
- Tools and GUI workflows to assist with migrating older Windows installations to modern hardware (boot repair workflows, driver injection helpers, guidance for preparing systems)
- GUI-driven utilities for image deployment, unattended setup helpers, and group deployment workflows for IT environments
- Graphical tools for data recovery, partition inspection, file restoration, and system cleanup/trimming
- Utilities to customize and slim Windows images (image management helpers; non-destructive tools for administrators)
- GUI wrappers around commonly used forensic and recovery utilities to simplify authorized maintenance tasks

> ‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE: Any features that touch accounts, passwords, or encrypted volumes are provided **only** as tools for authorized recovery or diagnostics and **do not** include or endorse ways to bypass security protections. For encrypted volumes (BitLocker, etc.), users must follow official recovery channels (recovery keys, organizational IT procedures, or Microsoft account recovery) unless they have explicit legal authorization and evidence of ownership.
